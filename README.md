# Introduction
We conducted a genome-wide assessment of balancing selection (BLS) in the red fire ant, </i>Solenopsis invicta</i>. 
We analysed 218 </i>S. invicta</i> genomes from their native range to identify and describe candidate genes under BLS. Our research revealed four genes showing a strong signal of BLS, which was consistent across populations. Notably, these genes are primarily associated with neurological function rather than the immune response, which is often highlighted in similar studies of other organisms. We speculate that this distinctive pattern could be attributed to the superorganism-like nature of a social insect colony
